Apart from bad culture fits, each person can feel comfortable in a team. It all depends on the elements of the environment so that everyone can feel comfortable.

Let's make this simple...

## ## #Everyone needs to:

- feel their opinion is valued (listen)
- have an opportunity to speak
- have the freedom to speak their mind
- be welcomed on entry (hospitable environment)
- be able correct another in an attempt to _clearly_ make the team member _better_
